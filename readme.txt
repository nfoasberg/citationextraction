These scripts are created to download PDFs from a repository (in this case, CUNY Academic Works), identify their bibliographies, extract the bibliographies into text files, and then pull the journal citations from the text files to CSVs. They are numbered based on the order in which they should be executed.

The scripts are not perfect!! The output still requires a lot of manual reformatting. However, it is much faster than reading through all the bibliographies by hand.

Much of this is based on Alf Sweigart's code in "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python," found here: https://automatetheboringstuff.com/chapter13/

Finally, if you see ways to improve these scripts, please let me know!
